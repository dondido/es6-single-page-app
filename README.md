# ES6 Single Page App
## Synopsis
ES6 single page application boilerplate without a framework.
## Features
This app features best practices in the following areas:
* Secure token based authentication - Successful token authentication system requires us to have detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities and possible pitfalls associated with them. Single page app tend to have a complex structure: logged in view, the logged out view, or the restricted view. A basic example of this is when a user navigates to an app home address, based on if he is logged in or not, he is served with an account or login view content under the same url. It all comes down to access control. Users get the same app but they may not have the same levels of access.
